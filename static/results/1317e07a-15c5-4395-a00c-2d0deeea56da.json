By using the following line of code, we can resolve the issue:\r\n\r\nconst coverImageLocalPath = res?.files?.coverImage?.[0]?.path\r\n\r\nThis shorthand allows us to apply optional chaining on arrays as well.

Regarding the code you mentioned at 20:33, there's a handy shorthand we can utilize to fix the error using optional chaining. By using the following line of code, we can resolve the issue:\r\n\r\nconst coverImageLocalPath = res?.files?.coverImage?.[0]?.path\r\n\r\nThis shorthand allows us to apply optional chaining on arrays as well. Once again, thank you for your guidance!\n\n2.
